Notes:
* As usual, it's a good idea to create a virtual environment (venv) to run this code in.
* Simplemediawiki: pip install not good (python2), should instead use 
  https://github.com/iliana/python-simplemediawiki/blob/develop/simplemediawiki.py
  (Included in this directory just in case; can be copied to venv_dir/lib/python_ver/site-packages/ )
* Helpers:
** When listing page titles to search for, need to use names with spaces rather than underscores
** Going through all pages does not list pages if they are within a category.
* Added query_delay parameter to give the mediawiki server a breather
* mwlib apparently does not handle wikis in other languages, nor does the parser handle empty content well.
** Language issue caused ImageLinks and CategoryLinks to turn into ArticleLinks
** Also removes all html comments, so if you want to keep those, need to copy the medaiwiki table mechanism for those.
* If you find multiple pages with the same title, use
  site_url/mediawiki/index.php?title=Foo&curid=1234  to differentiate.

General info:
This code was used to transfer part of an old Finnish mediawiki install to a dokuwiki elsewhere in 2026-02.  If you want to use it, good luck and hopefully you understand Python so you can make the modifications you need.  
I've tried to make the commits easily separable, but if you're going to try to use this code, branching off from the commit where this text last changed is probably a good idea.  Everything after this is going to be more to either handle personal preferences or the quirks of the original mediawiki, so it may not be as generally usable.
The original mediawiki had a few extra categories, but they were not well maintained, so page titles had some complications.  There were also other problems such as orphaned redirects from renaming back and forth.
The stuff in the extras directory was mostly used to search for different pages & images which might be included in the transfer, and then writing those in the same format that yamdwe would get them from the mediawiki with all_pages or all_images.
The pmw2dw.py (partial mediawiki to dokuwiki) file in the main directory was used to add extra functionality for a cleaner transfer.  Note especially that the dokuwiki had the exttab plugin so that tables could be kept in their more complicated form.  (Some editing by hand will still be necessary, and the typography / wrap plugin might be useful for prettier output.)
